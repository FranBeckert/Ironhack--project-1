# **Violin game**
##### This is the first project I did during the Ironhack bootcamp
---

##### As a violin teacher, I was trying to make a game to learn a music.
##### The music is broken in 3 parts. Player should first repeat the melodie and after that play along with piano accompaniment.
##### In the end player will play the whole music with accompaniment.
##### It is a game with the purpose of learning the note names and their positions on the neck of the violin.
##### The music played is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, usually the first learnt on violin (When following the Suzuki methodology)

##### I was trying to follow what I learned in the Pizza-project lab. I had also help to do some logic parts.
##### The code could be more organized, but by this point I am satisfied.      
##### The tracks were recorded at home using a digital piano.
##### I took a lot of code information from youtube, like:
